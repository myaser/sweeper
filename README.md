## usage ##
here is a snippet 

```python

from sweeper.gui import App
from sweeper import Robot, PlayGround
from sweeper.client import Client

class MyClient(Client):
    def set_up(self):
        #  do your magic here

    def process(self):
        #  do your magic here

my_robot = Robot(0.5)  # initialize with distance between robot's center of math and the metal detector sensor
delta_playground = PlayGround(400)  # initialize with the Area of the playground

app = App(my_robot, delta_playground)
MyClient(app)
app.start()
```

inside `set_up`, `process` you should do calls to:
* `Client.move_robot_to((x, y, theta))`
* `Client.mark_current_block_as_buried_mine_block()`
* `Client.mark_current_block_as_surface_mine_block()`
* `Client.redraw_gui()`

`set_up` runs once. and it is the place to put your initialization 

`process` is runs repeatedly untill the program be paused or stopped. put your worker logic here
